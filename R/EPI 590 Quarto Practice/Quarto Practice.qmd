#EXERCISE: Play around with theme!! two spaces- it needs to be exact
#EXERCISE 4: Let’s not print the code from creating the tables. Using an option for the whole document, make it so that we don’t see the code from any of the chunks.
execute: 
  echo: false 
  
 #i want to keep echo false- it is a cleaner look
  
 #to make the gtsummary tables colorful, use the following. it removes the indents though. 
 #as kable: true

# Customization of `tbl_summary()`

```{r}
tbl_summary(
  nlsy,
  by = sex_cat,
  include = c(sex_cat, race_eth_cat, region_cat,
              eyesight_cat, glasses, age_bir))

```{r}

              eyesight_cat, glasses, age_bir),
  label = list(
    race_eth_cat ~ "Race/ethnicity",
    region_cat ~ "Region",
    eyesight_cat ~ "Eyesight",
    glasses ~ "Wears glasses",
    age_bir ~ "Age at first birth"
  ),
  missing_text = "Missing")
```

EXERCISE SET 2:

```{r}
#| error: true
#| eval: true
tbl_summary(
  nlsy,
  by = sex_cat,
  include = c(sex_cat, race_eth_cat, region_cat,
              eyesight_cat, glasses, age_bir))

```

Great! So error true gave me an idea of what the error is. Here is the corrected code:

```{r}
tbl_summary(
  nlsy,
  by = sex_cat,
  include = c(sex_cat, race_eth_cat, region_cat,
              eyesight_cat, glasses, age_bir))
```

INLINE R
I want to add `r 3+4` participants
There were `r nrow(nlsy)` participants

but the spacing is weird, so to make the spacing right, need the double line 
INLINE R

I want to add `r 3+4` participants

There were `r nrow(nlsy)` participants

```{r}
#| label: tbl-one
#| tbl-cap: "This is the first  table"
knitr::kable(mtcars)
```
NEED TO RUN PREV CHUNKS for this to work!!!!!!!
```{r}
#| error: true
#| label: tbl-sex
#| tbl-cap: "descriptive statistics stratified by sex"

tbl_summary(
  nlsy,
  by = sex_cat,
  include = c(sex_cat, race_eth_cat, region_cat,
              eyesight_cat, glasses, age_bir))
```
DOne

The descriptive statistics are shown stratified by sex (@tbl-sex). 
```{r}

mean_sleep_weekend <- mean(nlsy$sleep_wknd, na.rm = TRUE) 
```

People slept an average of `r mean_sleep_weekend` hours
